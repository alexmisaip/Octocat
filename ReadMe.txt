                           |   \BWelcome dear player!\0   |
                           +==========================+


            You are reading the "man \YOctocat\0", called "ReadMe".

You have to execute \YOctocat\0 by typing "make run" or"./\YOctocat\0" to play.

The menu is composed of 4 options :
\C- The Casual mode . . . (A)
- The Hardcore mode . . (B)
- The Blind mode  . . . (C)
- The Octoview mode . . (D)
- Reading the ReadMe  . (E)
- Changing the map  . . (F)
- Creating a new map  . (G)
- Quitting  . . . . . . (H)\0

\G<===============================+\0 Casual Mode \G+===============================>\0

The Casual mode is the classic maze's game : You have to move the \YOctocat\0
out of the maze. You have to navigate with \VW\0, \VA\0, \VS\0, \VD\0 and type \VENTER\0 to move
one by one.

\G<==============================+\0 Hardcore Mode \G+==============================>\0

The Hardcore mode is the same but harder : You have to type the entire path
and type \VENTER\0 to move the \YOctocat\0. The only difference is that you can
play only ONE time, so if the \YOctocat\0 is not out of the maze at the end
of your path, the \YOctocat\0 will be lost \RFOREVER\0 !!.

\G<===============================+\0 Blind Mode \G+================================>\0

The Blind mode is ... a blind mode : You have to move the \YOctocat\0 out of
the maze without seeing anything but your position and the exit.

\G<==============================+\0 Octoview Mode \G+==============================>\0

The Octoview mode is a little bit harder than the Casual one : You can't see
all the map, but only one block around you. Notice that you MUST play the
Octoview nighmare on this map!

\G<==============================+\0 Create a map \G+===============================>\0

You can also create a new map : You start at the beginning of the maze and you 
have to dig the way until the exit of the maze. The starting location of your 
maze is where is your last location. You have to enter \VZ\0 to change the mode 
\C(dig blocks, build blocks or build ending points)\0, \VX\0 to quit and save the map 
and \VC\0 to quit without saving. You will just have to select your map to play on
it.
